# 🤖 NAO Face Following

This project enables a NAO humanoid robot to detect and track human faces in real-time, adjusting its head orientation to maintain focus on the detected face. It's an engaging demonstration of human-robot interaction using NAO's built-in vision and motion capabilities.

## 📌 Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Utilizes NAO's camera to identify human faces.
- **Dynamic Head Tracking**: Adjusts head position to follow the detected face.
- **Autonomous Operation**: Runs independently without external control once initiated.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **NAOqi Framework**: For accessing NAO's sensors and actuators.
- **Choregraphe Suite**: Visual programming environment for behavior design.
- **Python**: Scripting language for custom behavior implementation.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `face_following.pml`: Choregraphe project file containing the behavior flow.
- `behavior_1/`: Directory with behavior scripts and resources.
- `manifest.xml`: Metadata file describing the behavior package.
